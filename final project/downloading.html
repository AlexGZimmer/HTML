          <h2>Digital Downloading</h2>
          <p class="desc">The history of digital downloading began in the early 90s with the creation of the mp3. 
           Another major milestone in digital downloading is the launch of illegal file sharing site Napster in 1999 which saw huge controversy when they were sued by Metallica.
        One way the music industry responded was through launching the itunes store which allowed people to buy songs at 99 cents. 
        However, this would not stop the decline of music sales as large numbers of people would still use illegal file sharing to access music as why pay any amount of money when you can get the same exact file for free. 
    Streaming in however would change this as now people had easier access to music at the cost of ownership.</p>

          <h2>MP3 Player</h2>
          <p class="desc"> The first mp3 player was the MPMan F10 launched in Asia in March of 1998 and was expensive and limited in its release. 
            The first mp3 player lauched in the US was te Rio PMP300 Diamond Multimedia which was launched later in 1998. 
            The most popular mp3 media player would be the ipod launched by apple in 2001 and was originally for the Macintosh only until 2002 when windows was included.
            The launching of itunes in 2003 would also be pivotal in the ipod's success as it became the most popular way to listen to music throughout the 2000s till the creation of the iphone in 2007.
            The launching of spotify for the iphone also began to cut into the ipods dominance as people had access to a gigantuan amount of music at their fingertips without having to download any files.
            By 2022 the ipod would be discontinued and like record players, cassette, and cd players has been regulated to a few aficanadoes or those of us simply refuse to change as the iphone and streaming continue to dominate how people consume music even today.
