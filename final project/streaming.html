            <td>Music streaming began like music downloading did with the rise of P2P sharing site Napster that allowed users to share music files with each other.
            Streaming differs from downloading in that while downloading is the act of downloading a music file, with streaming you don't even need to download anything. 
            You just need a active internet connection and you are able to listen to music. 
            This style of listening to music started with Pandora in 2005 and started to explode in popularity with spotify in 2008.
            Spotify allowed users to access a vast catalog of music to stream and unlike downloading does actually pay the artists though not by a lot.
            The popularity of streaming would lead to Youtube being a popular site to download entire albums to too stream and has also resulted in other streaming music sites like Apple Music in 2015.</td>

            <td><img > <img src="smartphones.jpg" alt="smartphones"></a></td>
            <td>The most popular device to stream music from is the smart phone as you can access youtube, apple music, and spotify to listen to music from easily which allows people to access a wide variety of music.
            One advantage besides simple ease of access that it has over downloading is that you don't need much space to stream music either on your device or physically like physical media requires.
            However, one disadvantage in comparison with downloading is that if you have no online connection then you have no access to your music. 
            Another disadvantage is that you don't own the music so it can also be taken away from you easily with many people encountering the problem of finding their favorite music taken off streaming sites due to mulitpole reasons, 
            a problem that you won't get by buying physical copies.</td>
