          <h2>The Compact Disc</h2>
          <p class="desc">The Compact disc was an invention from a collaboration of Philips and Sony and was first commercially released in Japan in OCtober 1982. CD's 
            would gain popularity starting in the 80s due to their conveniance in comparison to vinyl records and superior sound quality in comparison to cassettes. They will become the dominant music medium of the 90s 
            before losing popularity themselves in the early 2000s due to the rise of digital downloads which allowed consumers to acquire music without paying. 
            The compact disc also had a issue with sound quality (though not as bad as cassette) in comparison to vinyl records not because they were naturally 
            inferior to records but because the mastering techniques used by the music industry for cd's resulted in inferior sound quality.</p>

          <h2>The Compact Disc player</h2>
          <p class="desc">The first commercial cd player was released in October 1982 along with the compact disc in Japan and is named as the CDP-101. CD players were first introduced in the United States in 1983 would continue to gain popularity. 
            The release of a portable cd player in 1984 would be pivotal in creating competition with the cassette Sony Walkman. CD players also came as a part of giant stereo systems that often included cassette players and these systems had the best sound quality.
          Like for cassette, CD boomboxes were an inbetween option by being more portable than a stereo system but also better sound quality than a protable cd player. Boomboces either came as cd only or also had a cassette option. </p>
