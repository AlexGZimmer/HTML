          <p> 8-track is a physical music format that was created in 1964 by the Lear Jet corporation. 
            It was most popular from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s when it got replaced in popularity by the cassette tape which funny enough is a year older than the 8-track.
        It was most commonly used for car stereos and it's advantages were being able to play coninously without having to turn it around. It also looped back to the beginning of the album instead of having to be rewinded.
        However, it was not able to be rewinded at all which was a disadvantage becuase you had to fast forward through the whole album if you wanted to get to a favorite part of an album which along with problems with jamming and getting dirty.
    It has not experienced a resurgence like vinyl or cassette. 
    While it is considered obsolete, there are still a number of collectors out there for the 8-track and some bands have even released small batches of 8-track versions of their albums recently. </p>

          <p >In september 15 of 1965, Ford Motor Company offered 8-track players in 3 of its models of cars. This proved a major step forward for car stereos in that you could now take you're favorite album and listen to it on the go.
            Home players for the 8-track followed in 1966 which allowed people to listen to their 8-tracks at home and not just in their cars. Carryable 8-track players were also popular.
